Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

The one that I can remember the best was while doing the scenes assignment. This one really showed me and taught me what function can do and helped me learn the most about functions.
I really liked this assignment because I was able to see the different functions and code each one. But then I was able to call them all and put them together to make
a outdoor scene.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

In my personal opinion, the value of test functions are really good. At first, they seemed overwhemlming and frustrating. But as the semester went on,
I realized how the test functions were nice to I could troubleshoot what was wrong with my program. They have the ability to make it easier to make a program
without the hard work of scratching your head as to why your troubleshooting skills aren't working.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The process I used for my troubleshooting the programs that I wrote was to first read the error message to see what it was saying. If it was something that I could figure
out, then I was able to fix it right away. If it was something that I couldn't figure it out, then I would research what the error was and attempt to fix it that way. 
If that still didn't work, then I would ask my classmates why my program wasn't working. 99% of the time, that was all I needed to do. 
I don't think that I would change my troubleshooting technique for now, because it makes me figure it out before I asked for help. This also helped me to learn more ways to
troubleshoot the issues that I had.
